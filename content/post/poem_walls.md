# Walls

Let's build walls,  
A beautiful wall,   
Just hear my calls,  
Each and all.  
  
  
For each & every question,   
If the answer really matters,  
Then make a donation,  
No ropes and no ladders.  
  
  
What is your name?   
What's your age?   
Sir or a dame?   
Warrior or a mage?   
  
  
Left or Right?  
Where do you stay?  
Stand-up or oversight?  
What words do you say?   
  
  
Twitter or Facebook?  
What arms do you bear?  
Humane or by the book?   
Or you really don't care?   
  
  
Thank you for your answer!  
Grand walls did I build,   
Big and spread like cancer.  
In this darkness, I chilled.
