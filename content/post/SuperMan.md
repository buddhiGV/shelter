**<< ACT 1 >>**  

Rugma blushed again. She wanted to get up but his hands over her chest, holding her close, stopped her from making any moves.

Her heart was pacing around and she couldn't stop infatuating inside her mind. She hadn't imagined that doing something so unlawful would turn out to be so satisfying. She turned to face him, Mr. Manu Das, deep in his slumber. His face bore no trace of the strenuous work he had just put in. Although he seemed to sleep comfortably, she didn't miss the fact that they were lying on a makeshift mattress made of some stray canvases and his jacket.   

Her thoughts drifted off to that moment in which they met for the first time. Her husband, Mr. Rohit Manjunath, had organized a grand party to welcome new addition to the company's board of directors. It was her husband who introduced her to Manu. Manu was impeccably dressed and looked charming and that's what caught her eyes initially. Also he had his sheepish grin on his face with almost a devilish innocence. And of course, Manu’ s wife, Maya was there too. Maya had put on an obnoxious amount of makeup. She was pretty but there was something artificial about her face. She looked even more short beside Manu, who was 6.2”. Manu seemed quite interested in talking with her throughout the party, especially about her art gallery chain that Rugma owned across many cities. Rugma was herself, a painter, mostly using acrylics , inspired from Elaine Kooning and Annie Besant. She remembered that had mistaken Manu’s genuine interest in art for social chit-chat. But he was more smitten by her, when he saw her work in her gallery. His visits became more often to her gallery. Although he did not buy any of the paintings, hers or of others, he did however spent hours discussing each painting with her. With each visit, they grew closer to each other. Manu was very flirtatious and passionate but also sophisticated with deep wisdom in his words. She soon found out that Manu was a self-made man. From his humble beginnings in Mumbai, Manu had to work very hard to get to where he is now. Not only was he good in business decisions, but also very sporty. He was an advent swimmer and tennis player. “Maybe, that’s the reason for his chiseled body”, she imagined, with her thoughts back to the present. This was the first time that Manu stayed back until the gallery closing time. She was wondering when he would leave but she did very much like his company, in the empty gallery. They talked some more and just at the right moment, he had leaned forward to give her a kiss which she had equally reciprocated. Their passions grew like a wildfire which they consummated right there, on the gallery floor. He turned out ot be more beautiful than she had fantasized and like an ocean , she rode on all of his waves. She reassured herself, Manu was a perfect man in every sense. He was passionate, witty, hardworking and honest. “God knows how he ended up with Maya…”, she thought to herself and before she could think more, Manu opened his eyes.  

_“Hey, beautiful! What are you thinking about?”_, quipped Manu, teasing a hair away from her face. Rugma blushed again.
