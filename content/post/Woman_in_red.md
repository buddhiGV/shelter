I saw you today, dressed in red.  
Thought of all the words,  
some spoken, and some unsaid.  
<!--more-->
Thought of all the dreams we had,  
And moments we shared.  
A million possibilities,  
Only if you had just cared,  
To hold my hands and be with me,  
But you left me, undead.  
Now someone else is behind your smile,   
While I move on with my regrets.
